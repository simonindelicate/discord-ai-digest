# Discord Daily Digest Bot

This bot collects messages from all text channels in a Discord server over the past day, summarizes the discussion using OpenAI's API, and compiles a list of shared links. The summary and links are then posted to a designated digest channel.

> **Important Note:**  
> As written, this bot is not secure. You should create a dotenv file for your API keys (and any other sensitive information) if you plan to run it anywhere other than locally.

## Features

- **Daily Digest:** Automatically posts a summary and shared links every 24 hours.
- **Manual Summarization:** Use the `!summarize` command to trigger a digest manually.
- **Customization:** Easily personalize channel names and credentials in the `bot.py` file.
- **Enhanced Link Previews:** Fetches and displays link previews using Newspaper and BeautifulSoup.
- **Reply Context & Embed Processing:** Includes original message context for replies and processes embeds.
- **Attribution:** This bot is based on a script by Simon Indelicate.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Discord Bot
- Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
- Navigate to the **Bot** section and click **Add Bot**.
- Copy the Bot Token and save it securely.
- Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable **Message Content Intent**.

### 2. Get an OpenAI API Key
- Sign up or log in at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
- Navigate to the API section to create a new API key.
- Copy your OpenAI API Key.

### 3. Personalize the Bot
- Open the `bot.py` file.
- Replace the placeholder strings `"YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"` and `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual tokens, or set them as environment variables (`DISCORD_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- Modify `DIGEST_CHANNEL_NAME` if you want the summary to be posted in a channel with a different name.
- Update `EXCLUDE_CHANNELS` if you need to ignore additional channels for link extraction.

### 4. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher is recommended). Install the required packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 5. Run the Bot Locally or Online
- **Locally:** Run the bot using:
  
  python bot.py

- **Online (e.g., Heroku, Replit, etc.):**  
  Make sure you set the required environment variables (`DISCORD_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`). Deploy the code according to your chosen platform's instructions.

### 6. Inviting the Bot to Your Server
- Go back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Under **OAuth2** > **URL Generator**:  
  - Select the **bot** scope.
  - Choose the permissions your bot needs (at minimum, it requires permissions to read messages and send messages).
- Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot to your server.

## Usage

### Automatic Daily Digest
- The bot automatically collects messages and posts the digest every 24 hours at midnight (UTC) in the channel specified by `DIGEST_CHANNEL_NAME`.

### Manual Commands
- **`!summarize`**  
  Manually triggers a digest for the past 24 hours and posts it in the current channel.
  
- **`!admin`**  
  Similar to `!summarize` but with debug logging enabled. Useful for troubleshooting and verifying the digest generation process.

## Additional Notes
- The bot uses OpenAI's Chat API with the model set as `gpt-4o-mini`. If you have access to a different model or need to change settings, update the model name and parameters in the `generate_summary` function.
- Logs are output to the console to help monitor the botâ€™s activity and any potential errors.
